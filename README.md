## Host Machines Setup

Currently, I run a two node cluster where each node runs NixOS.
I use [nixos-anywhere](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere/tree/main) to install NixOS on hosts.
This were the procedure I carried out to set them up, mostly following the nixos-anywhere [quickstart guide](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md).

_Work in progress..._
