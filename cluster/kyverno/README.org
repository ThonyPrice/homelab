#+title: Kyverno

* About

Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes.
Currently, I only run it to provide a fix for longhorn on NixOS...

Background: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/networking/cluster/k3s/docs/examples/STORAGE.md

* Setup

This kustomization is a small addition to the Kyverno Helm chart defined in ArgoCD apps.
See ~homelab/cluster/argocd-apps/kyverno.yaml~.
